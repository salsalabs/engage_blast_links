# engage_blast_links
Retrieve a CSV of all email blast URLs for an Engage client.

# Summary
This application uses the Engage Website Developer API to retrieve a list of email blasts
from an Engage client.  The list of email blasts contains the usual identity information.
It also contains the public-facing URL for the email blast.

The public-facing URL for the blast can be placed into a client's website as a way to let
supporters see past blasts.

The app is written in Python version 2.7, and old and creaky version that needs to be hauled off.
However it's the version that appears in MacOSX, and all of the folks that would use this app in
Salsa are on Macs.

TL;DR

This section is for folks that don't want to read the long version.  Use at your own risk.

I ain't sayin'.  I'm just sayin'...

Open a terminal woindow.  Change the directory to the dir where you want the app's directory
to live.  This demo uses ```Projects```.

```
sudo easy_install pip
pip install unicodecsv pyyaml 'requests>=2.23.0'
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/salsalabs/engage_blast_links.git
cd engage_blast_links
```

If you get here without any egregious errors, then proceed at best speed to the section
labeled "Configuration".

#Prerequisites

This is a checklist of the things that you _must have_ before you install this application.
If you do not have any items in this list then STOP.  Get help from one of the technical types
in Salsa Client support.

* Git

The ```git``` app is the tool that's used to access a Github repository.  We need ```git```
because Salsa has stored the app in a git repository.  

Finding and installing git is outside the scope of this document.  You might try using
[BrewPub](https://brew.sh/).  A very good tool for installing software on a mac.  You can also
go directoy to [the git site](https://git-scm.com/) and download the Mac version.

* Python version 2.7.

The best way to find out if you have Python 2.7 is to open a Terminal window (_not_ a Console window)
and type this at the prompt.

``` python --version```

You should see something like this.

```Python 2.7.16```

If
* the Python program exists, and
* you get a message that says that the Python version is ```2.x```, where ```x``` is 7 or greater, and
* you do not get a message that says that the version is ```3.x```

then you have the correct version installed.  If you do not see those three things, then STOP.  Get help
installing Python 2.7.

* Password for your Mac

If you are logged into your Mac, then you have the password for it.  If you're not logged in, then 
STOP.  Contact IT Corporate Support.

* Web Developer API token for Engage.
_Caution_: If you haven't got a clue about what this means, then
it's [time to read the doc](https://help.salsalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001220274-General-Information)
and [read the other doc](https://help.salsalabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001175053-Web-Developer-API-Overview).
That will give you the info that you need to return the Web Developer API token.

If you're still confused after reading the doc the STOP.  Get help.

# Installation

The application is installed in two steps.  

1. Install the app's dependencies.
2. Install the app itself.

## Dependencies

This application needs one administrative tool and three libraries.

* PIP

PIP is the tool that Python uses to install libraries.  There's a pretty good chance that you don't have
this installed if you are working on a Mac.  Given those odds, let's just go ahead and install PIP.

Open a Terminal window and type this line.

```sudo easy_install pip```

You'll be prompted for a password.  Type in the password that you used to log into your Mac.  If you're not successful,
the you'll get another prompt for your password.  If you fail three attempts then STOP.  You're not using the
correct password.  Contact IT Corporate Support.

If you see an error message indicating that easy_install doesn't exist, then STOP.  Contat IT Corporate Support.

If the installation is working, you'll see a lot of text go by.  Some of it may be yellow.  There might be a progress bar.

To confirm that pip is installed, type this.

```pip```

You'll see the pip help options.

```Usage:   
  pip <command> [options]

Commands:
  install                     Install packages.
  download                    Download packages.
  uninstall                   Uninstall packages.
  freeze                      Output installed packages in requirements format.
  list                        List installed packages.
  show                        Show information about installed packages.
  check                       Verify installed packages have compatible dependencies.
  config                      Manage local and global configuration.

  completion                  A helper command used for command completion.
  debug                       Show information useful for debugging.
  help                        Show help for commands.

General Options:
  -h, --help                  Show help.
```
If pip is not installed the STOP and get help installing pip.

## Libraries

The libraries that this app needs are installed using pip.  Open a terminal window and type this.

```pip install unicodecsv pyyaml 'requests>=2.23.0'```

Pip will retrieve the libraries.  Usually takes just a bit.  If pip stops and complains, then that's
an error.  STOP.  Get help installing the libraries.

# Install the app

1. Open a console window.
2. Change to the directory where you want the app's directory to live.  We'll use the ```Projects```
folder that appears in nearly everyone's home directory.
``` cd ~/Projects```.
3. Retrieve the app directory from Github.
```git clone https://github.com/salsalabs/engage_blast_links.git```

If git complains then STOP.  Get help with git.

#Configuration

The application needs to know which Engage instance to use when retrieving email blast information.
We provide that information in a YAML login file.  A YAML file is a text file with a straightforward format.
Here's an example of the contents of a YAML login file.

```yaml
devToken: your enormously long Engage Web Developer API token here
```

Here's a more detailed definition of what goes into the YAML login file.

| Field name | Contents | Notes | Example |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ------- |
|token | Integration API token | Not used for this app | ```token: REWQTERWEQR#$@#$@```|
|host  | Integration API host | (optional) defaults to api.salsalabs.org| ```host: hq-ua.igniter.bof```|
|devToken| Web Developer API token| Required for this app |  ```devToken: REWQTERWEQR#$@#$@```|
|devHost | Web Developer API host | (optional) defaults to dev-api.salsalabs.org| ```devHost: hq-ua.igniter.bof```|




The best way to create this file is to use a text editor.  A good practice is to put a useful name on the file
like "client.yaml" or "peanut_butter.yaml" so that you'll know what's in the file.  We'll use the YAML login
file in the "Execution" step.

#Execution

This is where we _finally_ get things started.

First, let's make sure that the app is running correctly.  Open a terminal window and type this.

```python email_blast_links.py --help```

You should see this.

```
usage: email_blast_links.py [-h] [--login LOGINFILE]

Display email blast URLs for Engage

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --login LOGINFILE  YAML file with login credentials
```

If you don't see that, then STOP and get help running a Python program.

To run the application, provide a login YAML file.  For this example, we'll use "squirrels.yaml".
it's a file with contents like this.

```yaml
token: devToken: REWQTERWEQR#$@#$@
```

To extract the Enage blast information using "squirrel.yaml", type this.

`python email_balst_links.py --login squirrell.yaml`

You'll see text like this:

```
mail_blast_links.py:34: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe. Please read https://msg.pyyaml.org/load for full details.
  cred = yaml.load(open(args.loginFile))

 80/400
 90/400
100/400
   .
   .
   .
Output may be found in email_blasts_urls.csv   
```

Disregard the "YAMLLoadWarning" message.

The status lines contain the number of records read, a slash, and the number of records to read.
The status lines continue until the job is done.
The last ine lets you know where the CSV with the results lives.  Open that file, and you'll see something like this.
